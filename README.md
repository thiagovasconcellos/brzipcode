## Getting Started

You can install the package via npm or yarn

```bash

```

```bash
yarn add brzipcode
```

### Usage

There are 3 methods you can use:

  * ZipCodesFromGivenState
  * StateFromZipCode
  * isZipCodeInState

### Examples

**ZipCodesFromGivenState** returns an object as it follows:

**state**: Name of state

**range**: Array of ZipCodes with Start and Finish (Some brazilians states has 2 arrays)
```js
import {ZipCodesFromGivenState} from 'brzipcodes'

const data = ZipCodesFromGivenState('SP')

console.log(data)
```
output
``` output
{
  state: 'SÃ£o Paulo',
  range: [ { start: '11000-000', finish: '19999-999' } ]
}
```

**StateFromZipCode** returns an string with the state abbreviation of given ZipCode:

**Work with numbers only**

```js
import {StateFromZipCode} from 'brzipcodes'

const data = StateFromZipCode(11320130)

console.log(data)
```
output
``` output
SP
```

**isZipCodeInState** a boolean that uses the two methods above to determinated either a ZipCode belongs to a State or not

```js
